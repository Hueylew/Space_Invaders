{"name":"Space Invaders","tagline":"Python clone with a modern twist","body":"### About\r\nSpace Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally\r\nacross the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of ten aliens that move\r\nhorizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien,\r\nand earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music\r\nboth speed up. \r\n\r\nThe aliens attempt to destroy the ship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom,\r\nthe alien invasion is successful and the game ends. A special \"mystery ship\" will occasionally move across the top of the\r\nscreen and award bonus points if destroyed. The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are\r\ngradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens and player.\r\n\r\n### How To Play\r\n - If you don't have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed, you can simply double click the .exe file to play the game.\r\n   **Note:** *The .exe file needs to stay in the same directory as the sounds, images, and font folders.*\r\n   \r\n - If you have the correct version of Python and Pygame installed, you can run the program in the command prompt / terminal.\r\n ``` c\r\n \tcd SpaceInvaders\r\n \tpython spaceinvaders.py\r\n ```\r\n **Note:** If you're using Python 3, replace the command \"python\" with \"python3\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nThanks for checking out my game and I hope you enjoy it!
